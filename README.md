## Languages That Can Be Covered

- [x] **ABAP**
ABAP is a high-level programming language created by the German software company SAP SE. It is currently positioned, alongside Java, as the language for programming the SAP Application Server, which is part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

- [x] **Assembly**
An assembly language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system.

- [x] **Autoit**
AutoIt is a freeware automation language for Microsoft Windows. In its earliest release, the software was primarily intended to create automation scripts for Microsoft Windows programs but has since grown to include enhancements in both programming language design and overall functionality.
- [x] **BASIC**
BASIC is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.

Delphi is both an object oriented programming language (OOP) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Published by the Embarcadero company (formerly CodeGear and more formerly Borland), Delphi is an alternative to language such as Visual Basic offering development with both rapidity and good quality. 

- [x] **Elixir**

Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides a productive tooling and an extensible design.

- [x] **Emojic**

- [x] **Erlang**

Erlang is a general purpose or you might say a functional programming language and runtime environment. It was built in such a way that it had inherent support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. Erlang was originally developed to be used in several large telecommunication systems. But it has now slowly made its foray into diverse sectors like ecommerce, computer telephony and banking sectors as well.

- [x] **F#**

- [x] **Fortran**

- [x] **Go**

Go is a programming language created in 2009 by Google employees Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is a statically typed, compiled language in the tradition of C, with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

- [x] **Groovy**

- [x] **Haskell**

- [x] **HTML**

Html Stands For Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

- [x] **INTERCAL**

INTERCAL was created in 1972 by two hackers from Princeton as a parody to satirizes various aspects of programming languages then. Anything that the compiler couldn't understand got skipped and the entire code read like someone pleading. The language was Turing-complete, and hence capable of implementing any algorithm. Though the programmer might be driven into advanced stages of insanity from the attempt.

- [x] **Java**

Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

- [x] **JavaScript**

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.

- [x] **Julia**

- [x] **Juliar**

- [x] **Kotlin**

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. While the syntax is not compatible with Java, the JVM implementation of the Kotlin standard library is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the collections framework. 

- [x] **Lisp**

- [x] **Lua**

- [x] **Matlab**

MATLAB is a high-level programming language designed for engineers and scientists that expresses matrix and array mathematics directly. You can use MATLAB for everything, from running simple interactive commands to developing large-scale applications.

- [x] **Nim**

Nim is a systems and applications programming language. Statically typed and compiled, it provides unparalleled performance in an elegant package.

- [x] **Objective-C**

- [x] **OCaml**

OCaml or Objective Caml, is a general purpose programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety.

- [x] **Pascal**

- [x] **Perl**

- [x] **Perl 6**

- [x] **PHP**

PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a server-side scripting language designed for Web development, but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.

- [x] **PostScript**

- [x] **PowerShell**

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. PowerShell runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- [x] **Prolog**

- [x] **Python**

- [x] **R**

- [x] **Ruby**

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.
He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.

- [x] **Rust**

- [x] **Scala**

- [x] **Shakespeare**

The Shakespeare Programming Language is a programming language created with the design goal to make the source code resemble Shakespeare plays.  There are no fancy data or control structures, just basic arithmetic and gotos. The language combines the expressiveness of BASIC with the user-friendliness of assembly language, but is much more verbose.

- [x] **Shell**

A shell is a type of computer program called a command-line interpreter that lets Linux and Unix users control their operating systems with command-line interfaces. Shells allow users to communicate efficiently and directly with their operating systems. Shell scripting is one of the simplest ways to set up automation. Using Linux or Unix commands, shell scripting gives data scientists, DevOps, and TechOps people conditional and loop control structures to repeat commands.A shell has two categories, command-line shell and graphical shell. Command-line shells are accessed using command-line interfaces where systems receive input in human-readable commands and then use the command-line interfaces to display the output. 

- [x] **Solidity**

- [x] **SQL**

SQL (structured query language) is a language for specifying the organization of databases (collections of records). Databases organized with SQL are called relational, because SQL provides the ability to query a database for information that falls in a given relation. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Essentially, it’s a language that allows communication with databases in order to manage all the data they contain. 

- [x] **Standard ML**

Standard ML is a general-purpose, modular, functional programming language with compile-time type checking and type inference; and a descendant of the ML programming language used in the Logic for Computable Functions theorem-proving project.

- [x] **Swift**

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products.

- [x] **Tool Comman Language(TCL)**

Tool command language (Tcl) is a powerful scripting language with programming features. It is available across Unix, Windows and Mac OS platforms. Tcl is used for Web and desktop applications, networking, administration, testing, rapid prototyping, scripted applications and graphical user interfaces (GUI).Tcl interfaces with the C language. Arrays of values that describe command arguments are passed to the command implementation functions.Tcl supports extension packages for additional functionality, including GUI, terminal-based application automation and database access.

- [x] **TypeScript**

TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.
